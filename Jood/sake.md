## The Brewing Process

### 1. Rice Polishing
The outer layers of the rice grain are polished to remove proteins and fats, leaving the starchy core. The polishing ratio (e.g., 60%, 50%) affects the sake's classification and flavor.

### 2. Washing and Soaking
The polished rice is washed to remove rice dust and soaked to achieve an optimal moisture level.

### 3. Steaming
Rice is steamed to soften it without making it too sticky, ensuring it can absorb water and grow koji mold effectively.

### 4. Koji Making
Steamed rice is inoculated with *Aspergillus oryzae* and left to ferment for two days in a controlled environment. Koji mold produces enzymes that break down starch into sugars.

### 5. Shubo (Starter Mash)
A mixture of koji rice, steamed rice, water, and yeast is created to develop a robust fermentation base.

### 6. Moromi (Main Mash)
The shubo is combined with more steamed rice, koji, and water in stages over several days. Fermentation lasts 20–30 days, producing alcohol.

### 7. Pressing, Filtering, and Bottling
The fermented mash is pressed to extract liquid sake, filtered for clarity, pasteurized, and aged before bottling.
