# Shochu Production Process

## 1. Ingredients and Preparation
- **Ingredients**: Barley, rice, sweet potatoes, or other grains.
- **Water**: Clean, high-quality water is crucial.
- **Yeast**: For fermentation.
- **Koji (Aspergillus oryzae)**: Mold used to convert starches into sugars.
  
## 2. Koji Preparation
- **Temperature**: 30°C (86°F)
- **Action**: Koji mold is inoculated onto steamed grains to break down starches into fermentable sugars.
  
## 3. Fermentation
- **Temperature Range**: 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F)
- **Duration**: Several days to a week.
- **Yeast Fermentation**: Yeast converts sugars into alcohol.

### Using Waste Heat from ASICs:
- **Purpose**: Regulate fermentation temperature using low-grade waste heat.
- **Method**: Directly heating the mash or using waste heat to maintain optimal conditions.

## 4. Distillation
- **Temperature Range**: 78°C to 85°C (172°F to 185°F)
- **Action**: The mash is distilled to separate alcohol from the fermented mash.

### Low-Heat Distillation:
- **Temperature Range**: 60°C to 75°C (140°F to 167°F)
- **Purpose**: Low-heat distillation preserves delicate flavors and aromas.

### Waste Heat Integration in Distillation:
- **Purpose**: Use the waste heat to preheat the mash before the distillation process.
  
## 5. Maturation (Aging)
- **Duration**: Months to years.
- **Storage**: Typically stored in earthenware containers or barrels.

## 6. Final Product
- **Shochu Characteristics**: Distilled alcoholic beverage with alcohol content typically between 25% and 45%.
