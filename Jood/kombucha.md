## Introduction

Kombucha is a fermented beverage made from sweetened tea and a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY). The fermentation process produces a tangy, effervescent drink rich in probiotics and organic acids.

## Ingredients

- **Tea:** Black or green tea from *Camellia sinensis* leaves.
- **Sugar:** Nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners.
- **Water:** Potable water.
- **SCOBY:** Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast.
- **Starter Liquid:** Pre-fermented kombucha to acidify the initial mixture.

*Note:* Optional flavorings, such as fruit juices or herbs, can be added during the secondary fermentation phase.

## Equipment

- Glass fermentation jar (1 to 5 gallons)
- Breathable cloth or paper towel
- Rubber band
- Stainless steel pot
- Wooden or plastic stirring utensil
- pH strips or meter
- Bottles with airtight lids for storage

## Preparation Steps

1. **Brew the Tea:**
   - Boil the desired amount of water.
   - Add tea leaves or tea bags (approximately 1 tea bag or 1 teaspoon of loose tea per cup of water).
   - Steep for 5–10 minutes, depending on tea strength preference.
   - Remove tea leaves or bags.

2. **Add Sugar:**
   - While the tea is hot, add sugar (about 1 cup per gallon of tea).
   - Stir until fully dissolved.

3. **Cool the Sweetened Tea:**
   - Allow the sweetened tea to cool to room temperature (68°F to 85°F or 20°C to 29°C).

4. **Combine with Starter Liquid:**
   - Pour the cooled tea into the fermentation jar.
   - Add the starter liquid (about 10% of the total volume) to acidify the mixture.

5. **Add the SCOBY:**
   - Gently place the SCOBY into the tea mixture.

6. **Cover and Secure:**
   - Cover the jar with a breathable cloth or paper towel.
   - Secure with a rubber band to prevent contaminants.

## Fermentation Process

1. **Primary Fermentation:**
   - Place the jar in a warm, well-ventilated area away from direct sunlight.
   - Maintain a temperature between 75°F and 80°F (24°C to 27°C) for optimal fermentation.
   - Allow to ferment for 7–14 days, depending on taste preference.
   - After 7 days, begin tasting the kombucha daily until the desired balance of sweetness and tartness is achieved.

2. **Secondary Fermentation (Optional):**
   - Remove the SCOBY and 10% of the kombucha to use as starter liquid for the next batch.
   - Transfer the fermented kombucha into bottles, leaving some headspace.
   - Add flavorings if desired (e.g., fruit juice, herbs).
   - Seal the bottles tightly and let them ferment at room temperature for 1–3 days to develop carbonation.
   - Refrigerate the bottles to halt fermentation and enjoy chilled.

## Safety and Quality Control

- **pH Monitoring:** Ensure the pH of the kombucha is below 4.2 before consumption to prevent harmful microbial growth.
- **Sanitation:** Thoroughly clean and sanitize all equipment before use.
- **Observation:** Regularly inspect the SCOBY and kombucha for signs of mold or off-odors. Discard any batches that show contamination.

## Utilizing Waste Heat in Kombucha Production

Maintaining the optimal fermentation temperature is crucial for kombucha production. Utilizing waste heat from equipment like ASICs can help sustain the desired temperature range, enhancing fermentation efficiency.

- **Heat Recovery Systems:** Implement systems to capture and redirect waste heat to the fermentation area.
- **Temperature Control:** Use thermostats and monitoring devices to maintain consistent temperatures.
- **Insulation:** Ensure fermentation vessels are properly insulated to retain heat.

By integrating waste heat utilization, energy consumption can be reduced, promoting a more sustainable production process.
