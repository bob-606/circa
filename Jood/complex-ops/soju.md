# Soju Production Process

## 1. Ingredients and Preparation
- **Ingredients**: Rice, barley, sweet potatoes, or other grains.
- **Water**: Clean, high-quality water is crucial.
- **Yeast**: For fermentation.
- **Koji (Aspergillus oryzae)**: Mold used to convert starches into sugars.

## 2. Koji Preparation
- **Temperature**: 30°C (86°F)
- **Action**: Koji mold is inoculated onto steamed grains to break down starches into fermentable sugars.
  
## 3. Fermentation
- **Temperature Range**: 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F)
- **Duration**: 7 to 14 days.
- **Yeast Fermentation**: Yeast converts sugars into alcohol.

### Using Waste Heat from ASICs:
- **Purpose**: Regulate fermentation temperature using low-grade waste heat.
- **Method**: Waste heat can be redirected to control fermentation temperatures.

## 4. Distillation
- **Temperature Range**: 78°C to 85°C (172°F to 185°F)
- **Action**: The mash is distilled to separate alcohol from the fermented mash.

### Low-Heat Distillation:
- **Temperature Range**: 60°C to 75°C (140°F to 167°F)
- **Purpose**: Low-heat distillation preserves delicate flavors and aromas.

### Waste Heat Integration in Distillation:
- **Purpose**: Use waste heat to preheat the mash and reduce energy consumption.
  
## 5. Filtration and Dilution
- **Filtration**: The distillate is filtered for clarity.
- **Dilution**: The alcohol concentration is reduced to desired levels, usually around 20% to 25% ABV.

## 6. Final Product
- **Soju Characteristics**: A distilled beverage with a neutral flavor, typically around 20% to 25% alcohol content.
