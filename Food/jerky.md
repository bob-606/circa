# How to Make Jerky and Fruit Rolls Using ASICs Heat

## Introduction
This guide will walk you through the process of making jerky and fruit rolls using ASICs heat. ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) can be repurposed to generate the necessary heat for dehydrating food.

## Materials Needed
- Meat (for jerky) or fruit puree (for fruit rolls)
- Marinade ingredients (for jerky)
- ASICs heat source
- Dehydrator trays or racks
- Parchment paper (for fruit rolls)
- Knife and cutting board
- Mixing bowls

## Steps for Making Jerky

1. **Prepare the Meat:**
    - Choose lean cuts of meat such as beef, turkey, or chicken.
    - Trim off any excess fat.
    - Slice the meat into thin strips, about 1/4 inch thick.

2. **Marinate the Meat:**
    - Prepare a marinade using your favorite ingredients (soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, etc.).
    - Place the meat strips in the marinade and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.

3. **Set Up the ASICs Heat Source:**
    - Position the ASICs heat source in a well-ventilated area.
    - Arrange the dehydrator trays or racks around the heat source.

4. **Dehydrate the Meat:**
    - Place the marinated meat strips on the trays, ensuring they are not overlapping.
    - Allow the meat to dehydrate for 6-12 hours, depending on the thickness of the strips and the heat output of the ASICs.

5. **Check for Doneness:**
    - The jerky is done when it is dry and firm but still slightly pliable.
    - Store the jerky in airtight containers.

## Steps for Making Fruit Rolls

1. **Prepare the Fruit Puree:**
    - Choose ripe fruits and wash them thoroughly.
    - Puree the fruits in a blender until smooth.
    - Optionally, add sweeteners or spices to taste.

2. **Set Up the ASICs Heat Source:**
    - Position the ASICs heat source in a well-ventilated area.
    - Line the dehydrator trays with parchment paper.

3. **Spread the Puree:**
    - Pour the fruit puree onto the parchment-lined trays.
    - Spread it evenly to about 1/8 inch thickness.

4. **Dehydrate the Fruit Puree:**
    - Allow the fruit puree to dehydrate for 4-8 hours, depending on the thickness and the heat output of the ASICs.
    - The fruit roll is done when it is no longer sticky to the touch.

5. **Cut and Store:**
    - Once dehydrated, cut the fruit roll into strips.
    - Roll them up in parchment paper and store in airtight containers.

## Conclusion
Using ASICs heat to make jerky and fruit rolls is an innovative way to repurpose technology for food preservation. Follow these steps to create delicious and healthy snacks at home.
