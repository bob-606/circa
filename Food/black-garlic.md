## How to Make Black Garlic with the Heat from ASICs

### Materials Needed
- Whole bulbs of garlic
- ASIC miners (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits)
- A container to hold the garlic

### Instructions
1. **Prepare the Garlic**: Clean the garlic bulbs and remove any dirt.
2. **Set Up the ASIC Miners**: Place the ASIC miners in a well-ventilated area to ensure proper airflow and cooling.
3. **Position the Garlic**: Place the garlic bulbs in a container that can withstand the heat generated by the ASIC miners. Ensure the container allows for some airflow.
4. **Monitor the Temperature**: The ideal temperature for making black garlic is around 140°F (60°C). Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature near the garlic.
5. **Fermentation Process**: Allow the garlic to ferment for 3-4 weeks, maintaining a consistent temperature and humidity. Check periodically to ensure the garlic is not drying out.
6. **Check for Readiness**: After the fermentation period, the garlic should be black and have a soft, jelly-like texture with a sweet, umami flavor.

### Tips
- Ensure the ASIC miners are running continuously to maintain a consistent temperature.
- Keep the garlic in a dark, humid environment to facilitate the fermentation process.

By utilizing the heat generated from ASIC miners, you can efficiently produce black garlic while also making use of the excess heat from your mining operations.
